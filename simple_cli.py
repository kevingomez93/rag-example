        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems 
        capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include

        Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can

        Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors

        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with 
        text generation. It works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base using 
        semantic search, then using those documents as context for a language model to generate 
        accurate and informed responses. This approach helps reduce hallucinations in AI responses.
